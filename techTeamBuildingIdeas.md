# Team Definition

*A team is a small number of people with
complementary skills who are committed to a common purpose, performance goals, and approach for which they are mutually accountable. - Katzenbach and Smith, 1993*

## Characteristics of effective teams

1. **Clear vision or purpose**   
– A vision is a clear, concise statement of purpose that engenders involvement and commitment. A vision provides a pulling force that can impel a team toward a new realization of its possibilities. A vision appeals to people’s motivations and captures their imaginations.

2. **Shared commitment**  
 – If each member is motivated to work for the vision, each works to his/her full potential to see that the group achieves success. In so doing, the work becomes its own reward.

3. **Clear roles and responsibilities**   
– Each team member knows what s/he is to do and knows the roles of other members and how they all interact to form the whole.

4. **Trust**  
– With clear commitment and roles, each person knows that s/he can rely on the others. With high trust, members are more willing to face challenges and support one another through ups and downs.

5. **Mutual accountability**  
– The collective responsibility of the team toward generating results and achieving success, in addition to the individual obligations in specific roles. This creates a supportive environment within the team, and the performance of the team improves in the presence of this type of mutual support and cohesion.

6. **Celebrate individual and team success**  
— Keep the whole in view, and work to support each other. Team success is valued in theory and in practice.

7. **Concern for group tasks and process**  
– Team members are skilled at raising both specific task issues and issues that explore how the team itself is functioning. These distinct perspectives are usually raised at different times by different team members--not everybody pays attention to both functions at all times, but both functions are always present.

8. **Address challenges with creativity**– The team strives to maintain a sense of openness and to solve problems creatively.

9. **Inclusive decision making**  
– Effective teams allow an appropriate level of group participation in decision making--not too much so decisions are agonizingly slow, and not too little to result in insufficient team input and commitment to agreements.

10. **Regular communication and feedback**  
— Team members give and receive feedback effectively.


### Effective Teams: What Makes Them Successful?

( colaborative workshop )


A. **BEST EXPERIENCE**:   
Think about a high point--a time when you felt you were involved in a really effective team; a time that stands out as significant, meaningful, empowering, or particularly successful in meeting the definition of a team. 

- what made it a good team? 
- How were you involved? 
- What key lessons did you learn?

B. **VALUES**:   
We all have different qualities and skills we bring to any team. Let’s reflect on those qualities and skills from different levels:

1. **YOURSELF**:   
Without being humble, what skills, qualities, knowledge, and/or experience do you bring to this team?
2. **YOUR TEAM**:   
What do you value most about being a part of this team? What best practices, skills, values, methods, or traditions are its strength?
3. **THREE WISHES**:   
If you had three wishes for this team, what would they be?
